# googletest-cmake-example
This is an example for creating a C++ library using GoogleTest framework with CMake:
- C++ 14 for googletest framework
- CMake 3.13

Many of the other examples available on github were outdated and using deprecated keywords from CMake or do not support current versions of GoogleTest framework.

This is inspired by:
